                </h3>
                <p>I like to combine my skills as a teacher, performer, and project manager into crafting immersive Dungeons & Dragons experiences for diverse groups of players. I've DM'd for a traditional high fantasy group at my CrossFit gym (levels 1-13!), a group of newbie friends in a low-combat/high-creativity home game, an online-only crew, and various one-shots. In my previous work I engaged students with lesson plans chock full of opportunities for belonging and collaboration; now I get to bring my storytelling abilities, sense of humor, and understanding of diverse needs to the table. I love tailoring adventures to each group's unique interests, backgrounds, identities, and even attention spans, and transporting my players into worlds where our imaginations and relationships can flourish.

                <p>I also have two delightful kitties, Nacho and Yuki. They were rescued from the same shed, where they bonded, and languished at the shelter for almost two years before I had the great fortune of scooping them up. They find a new snuggling configuration several times a day (when they're not wrestling).</p>
