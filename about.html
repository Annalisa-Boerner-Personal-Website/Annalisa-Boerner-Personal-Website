                    <p>
                        I like to combine my skills as a teacher, performer, and
                        project manager into crafting immersive Dungeons &
                        Dragons experiences for diverse groups of players. I've
                        DM'd for a traditional high fantasy group at my CrossFit
                        gym (levels 1-13!), a group of newbie friends in a
                        low-combat/high-creativity home game, an online-only
                        crew, and various one-shots. In my previous work I
                        engaged students with lesson plans chock full of
                        opportunities for belonging and collaboration; now I get
                        to bring my storytelling abilities, sense of humor, and
                        understanding of diverse needs to the table. I love
                        tailoring adventures to each group's unique interests,
                        backgrounds, identities, and even attention spans. (Photo from

                    I also have two delightful kitties, Nacho and Yuki. They
                    were rescued from the same cat-hoarder shed situation, where
                    they had bonded, then languished at the shelter for almost
                    two years before I had the great fortune of scooping them
                    up. They find a new snuggling configuration several times a
                    day (when they're not wrestling or begging for dinner).
