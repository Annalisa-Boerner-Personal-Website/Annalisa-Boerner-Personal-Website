            <div>
                <h3>D&D</h3>
                <p>
                    I like to combine my skills as a teacher, performer, and
                    project manager into crafting immersive Dungeons & Dragons
                    experiences for diverse groups of players. I've DM'd for a
                    traditional high fantasy group at my CrossFit gym (levels
                    1-13!), a group of newbie friends in a
                    low-combat/high-creativity home game, an online-only crew,
                    and various one-shots. In my previous work I engaged
                    students with lesson plans chock full of opportunities for
                    belonging and collaboration; now I get to bring my
                    storytelling abilities, sense of humor, and understanding of
                    diverse needs to the table. I love tailoring adventures to
                    each group's unique interests, backgrounds, identities, and
                    even attention spans, and transporting my players into
                    worlds where our imaginations and relationships can
                    flourish. (Photo from BeReal on an excellent Sunday in

                <p>
                    I also have two delightful kitties, Nacho and Yuki. They
                    were rescued from the same cat-hoarder shed situation, where
                    they had bonded, then languished at the shelter for almost
                    two years before I had the great fortune of scooping them
                    up. They find a new snuggling configuration several times a
                    day (when they're not wrestling or begging for dinner).
