                    As someone who is driven by a passion for justice, I have
                    always sought avenues to make a meaningful impact. Now, as I
                    embark on my transition to web development, I am excited to
                    apply my meticulous attention to detail and unwavering
                    commitment to high standards to my new field. As as a
                    classical musician and music educator, I strived to convey
                    messages through my performance and pedagogy; now I look
                    forward to conveying my company's mission and vision through
                    exceptional web experiences. I also aim to contribute to a
                    more equitable and inclusive digital world, where
                    accessibility is paramount.
